# Dead-End-Detector

# Overview
Dead-End Detector is a Python-based application built using the Tkinter library. It is designed to visualize and detect dead-end signs in a given street network represented by an adjacency matrix. The application allows users to input the number of locations (nodes) and streets (edges) in the network, specify the streets, and then visually analyze and identify dead-end signs within the network.

# Features
- Graph Visualization: The application provides a visual representation of the street network using a canvas and nodes for locations, with streets connecting them.
- Dead-End Detection: It employs graphs algorithm to detect dead-end signs within the network based on the provided adjacency matrix.
- User Interaction: Users can easily interact with the application by inputting the number of locations, streets, and specifying the streets' connections.

# Technologies Used
